# New Game of Life

## A game developed from Conway's Game of Life

This application, **New Game of Life**, can allow the user to play a game which is developed based on **Conway's Game 
of Life**. The users will be able to set the initial state by themselves, and to see how will the initial state go 
based on the rule, after pressing the start button. 

Generally, the users will be those who like trying and plying different games. In addition, those who are interested 
in **Conway's Game of Life** may also be drawn into the **New Game of Life**.

The reason why this project is interesting to me is that firstly, I want to make a game by myself. Secondly, I learned
a bit about **Conway's Game of Life** previously, and I was attracted by it. As a result, I decide to design the 
**Conway's Game of Life** to be a game that is developed from it. Therefore, here's the **New Game of Life**.

##User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a block to the initial state.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit a block in the initial state.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a block from the initial state.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the grid of the current generation visually.
- As a user, I want to be able to ask for the next generation of the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the grid with all blocks in current generation to file.
- As a user, I want to be able to load the grid with all blocks saved earlier from file.

##Phase 4: Task 2

Sat Nov 20 22:11:08 PST 2021     Add a block at 1, 1 with state 1

Sat Nov 20 22:11:13 PST 2021     Add a block at 2, 2 with state 1

Sat Nov 20 22:11:17 PST 2021     Edit the block at 2, 2 to state 2

Sat Nov 20 22:11:20 PST 2021     Delete the block at 1, 1


##Phase 4: Task 3
- If I had more time to work on the project, I will make Block class a private class in InitialGeneration class because
if I delete the GameOfLifeApp class (console part), no classes other than InitialGeneration use the Block class.
